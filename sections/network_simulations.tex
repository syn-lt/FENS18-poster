What parameters of a cortical circuit could match $\mu_b$ in the stochastic model and thus similarly shape the lifetime and weight distributions of synapses? To test this we simulated a detailed network model similar to \cite{Miner2016}. In the model we simulated $N_e = 400$ excitatory and $N_i = 80$ inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with membrane noise over $T=\text{\SI{1000}{s}}$. Synapses are conductance based and network connections within the excitatory population are inserted randomly over time at a low weight and eliminated if the weight falls below a global threshold. Spike-timing dependent plasticity and slow multiplicative synaptic normalization drive the synapse dynamics. We found that a parameter $D$, defined as integral of the STDP window for potentiation and divided by the integral of the STDP window for depression,
%
\begin{align}
  D = \frac{\,\,\,\,A_{\text{LTP}}\, \tau_{\text{LTP}}}{-A_{\text{LTD}}\,\tau_{\text{LTD}}}, 
\end{align}
%
where $A_{\text{LTP}}$, $A_{\text{LTD}}$ are the amplitudes and $\tau_{\text{LTP}}$, $\tau_{\text{LTD}}$ the time constants for STDP windows for potentiation and depression, shows a similar shaping of lifetime distributions in the network model (Fig.~\ref{fig:netwsim}A). We see however qualitatively different behaviour in the dynamics of the synaptic weight distributions (Fig.~\ref{fig:netwsim}B).

Interestingly, we find that a large number of other network parameters, such as membrane noise, do not affect the synaptic lifetimes. This points towards a fundamental relationship between the additive weight dynamics and the lifetimes of synapses.
