\section{Key points}

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] For lifetime and size distributions, Kesten process can be reduced to simpler autoregressive AR(1) process
\item[-] Lifetime distributions in the model approximately follow a power law as observed experimentally
\item[-] In both the stochastic model and detailed network simulations the bias in the additive changes in synaptic weight systematically shapes the lifetime distributions
\item[-] Increased noise results in both model and network simulation 
\end{itemize}
