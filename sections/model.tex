\section*{Model}

Kesten processes have been used before \cite{Statman2014} to describe spine size dynamics. In this model, a given spine size $X_n$ at time step $n$ is updated as
%
\begin{align}
  X_{n+1} = a_n X_n + b_n. \label{eq:kesten}
\end{align}
%
In this further simplified form we take $a_n$ to be a fixed value of $a_n < 1$, while the additive change is in each time step drawn from a normal distribution, $b_n \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_b, \sigma_b^2)$. Then, to model synapse growth and pruning processes, we consider a population of $N$ synapses. Each synapse has a random time $T_{\mathrm{init}}$, uniformly distributed in $[0,T_{\text{max}}]$, at which it is initialized with size $X_0$. The synapse size $X_t$ then evolves according to \eqref{eq:kesten}.

\medskip

The lifetime of the synapse is the number of time steps from $T_{\text{init}}$ until for the first time $X_t < X_{\mathrm{prune}}$. In this case the synapse gets pruned and a new synapse with size $X_0$ is inserted in the network (Fig.~\ref{fig:km}). In the case that $X_t$ doesn't fall below $X_{\mathrm{prune}}$ until $T_{\text{max}}$, the lifetime is recorded as $T=T_{\text{max}}-T_{\text{init}}$. At the end of the simulation the sizes $X_{T_{\text{max}}}$ are recorded for all $N$ synapses.
